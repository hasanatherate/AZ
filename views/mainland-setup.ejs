                    <p class="hero-description">
                        Setting up a mainland company in the UAE is one of the most powerful ways to establish a fully operational, legally recognized business that can trade anywhere within the Emirates and internationally. A mainland license allows you to operate without geographical restrictions, work with government entities, open corporate bank accounts, and hire an unlimited number of employees depending on your office space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At AZ Corporate Services, we make the process of forming a mainland company smooth, compliant, and efficient—guiding you through every government requirement and ensuring your business starts with a strong and secure foundation.

                <h2>What Is a Mainland Company in the UAE?</h2>
                <p>A mainland company is registered under the UAE Department of Economic Development (DED) of each emirate. It allows businesses to operate inside and outside the UAE without any limitations. This makes it the preferred choice for companies that plan to expand, hire employees, or work with government and semi-government bodies.</p>
                <p>Mainland companies enjoy unmatched flexibility, access to the entire UAE market, and the ability to operate in a wide range of commercial, professional, and industrial sectors.</p>
